# Contango Protocol V2

Contango V2 is a new way of building perpetual contracts on top of existing money markets. When a trader opens a position, the protocol borrows on a money market, swaps on the spot market, then lends back on the same money market. Join us at [contango.xyz](https://contango.xyz).
